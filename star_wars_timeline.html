        <h1>Full Timeline</h1>
    
        <div class = "Timeline_Introduction">
            <p>
                From when <strong>"A New Hope"</strong> was released on May 25, 1977 to 2012 when <em>Disney</em> bough Star Wars, <br>
                A plethora of creators filled in a galaxy's worth of stories. <br>
                And now, I write about a mostly complete timeline of stories that these authors have created. <br>
                I will do my best to detail any: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Books
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Comics
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Movies
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Games
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shorts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Web Comics
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Children's Books
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Young Adult Books
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                That I come across. <br>
                And so, here is a mostly complete story line of the Star Wars Universe until the Disney acquisition.

        <!-- Have a search button for titals, author's names, dates (in stars wars and out), and ISBN Number-->
        <!-- Maybe a sort system by:
            Star Wars Date
            Date Released
